# JMcD
## Description
This repository contains the code for the JMcD project. The project is a spin on the `NIEHS/P-MACD` project, and aims to find mutation clusters among SNVs (A3A mutations) with a better algorithm. It also generates figures showing clustered mutations found at various thresholds.

## Usage
Simply add CSV exported CLC data to the `data` folder and run the `main.py` script. The script will generate figures in `figures` folder and clusters in `clusters` folder. The script will also generate logs in the `logs` folder.
